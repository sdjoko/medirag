hydrochloride is indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2, or \u2265 27 kg/m2in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).\n - Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights.\n - BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.\n - The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine, [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1,12.2)] should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.\n - Phentermine hydrochloride\u00a0is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic indicated as a short-term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity for patients with an initial body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2, or \u2265 27 kg/m2in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).\n - The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including Phentermine hydrochloride, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.\n\n2\u00a0 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:\n - Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose.The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control.The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast. The dosage may be adjusted to the patient\u2019s need. For some patients, half tablet (18.75 mg) daily may be adequate, while in some cases it may be desirable to give half tablets (18.75 mg) two times a day.Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients \u2264 16 years of age.Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.\n - The recommended maximum dosage of phentermine hydrochloride is 15 mg daily for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2). Avoid use of phentermine hydrochloride in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis [seeUse in Specific Populations(8.6)andClinical Pharmacology(12.3)].\n\n2.1Exogenous Obesity:\n - Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose.The usual adult dose is one capsule (37.5 mg) daily as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast for appetite control.The usual adult dose is one tablet (37.5 mg) daily, as prescribed by the physician, administered before breakfast or 1 to 2 hours after breakfast.

The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with phentermine\u00a0 and any other drug products for weight loss including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations, and herbal products, or serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine), have not been established. Therefore, coadministration of phentermine and these drug products is not recommended.\n - Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH) \u2013 a rare, frequently fatal disease of the lungs \u2013 has been reported to occur in patients receiving a combination of phentermine with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine. The possibility of an association between PPH and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out; there have been rare cases of PPH in patients who reportedly have taken phentermine alone.The initial symptom of PPH is usually dyspnea. Other initial symptoms may include angina pectoris, syncope or lower extremity edema. Patients should be advised to report immediately any deterioration in exercise tolerance.

Teratogenic EffectsPregnancy category XPhentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. Phentermine has pharmacologic activity similar to amphetamine (d- and dll-amphetamine) [see Clinical Pharmacology(12.1)]. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phentermine. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.\n - It is not known if phentermine is excreted in human milk; however, other amphetamines are present in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n - Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended.\n - In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n - This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n - Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [seeClinical Pharmacology(12.3)].\n - Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [seeDosage and Administration(2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations.\n\n8.1\u00a0 Pregnancy:\n - Teratogenic EffectsPregnancy category XPhentermine is contraindicated during pregnancy because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm.

Because pediatric obesity is a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment, the use of this product, approved for short-term therapy, is not recommended.\n\n8.5\u00a0 Geriatric Use:\n - In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n - This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n8.6 Renal Impairment:\n - Based on the reported excretion of phentermine in urine, exposure increases can be expected in patients with renal impairment [seeClinical Pharmacology(12.3)].\n - Use caution when administering phentermine to patients with renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2), limit the dosage of phentermine to 15 mg daily [seeDosage and Administration(2.2)]. Phentermine has not been studied in patients with eGFR less than 15 mL/min/m2, including end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis; avoid use in these populations.\n\n9\u00a0 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE:\n - Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance.\n - Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program.\n - Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia.\n\n9.1\u00a0 Controlled Substance:\n - Phentermine is a Schedule IV controlled substance.\n\n9.2\u00a0 Abuse:\n - Phentermine is related chemically and pharmacologically to the amphetamines. Amphetamines and other stimulant drugs have been extensively abused and the possibility of abuse of phentermine should be kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including a drug as part of a weight reduction program.\n\n9.3\u00a0 Dependence:\n - Abuse of amphetamines and related drugs may be associated with intense psychological dependence and severe social dysfunction. There are reports of patients who have increased the dosage of these drugs to many times than recommended. Abrupt cessation following prolonged high dosage administration results in extreme fatigue and mental depression; changes are also noted on the sleep EEG. Manifestations of chronic intoxication with anorectic drugs include severe dermatoses, marked insomnia, irritability, hyperactivity and personality changes. A severe manifestation of chronic intoxication is psychosis, often clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia.\n\n10\u00a0 OVERDOSAGE:\n - The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage.\n - Manifestations of acute overdosage include restlessness, tremor, hyperreflexia, rapid respiration, confusion, assaultiveness, hallucinations, and panic states. Fatigue and depression usually follow the central stimulation. Cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, arrhythmia, hypertension or hypotension, and circulatory collapse.

The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an \u201canorectic\u201d drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss.\n - The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks\u2019 duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.\n\n16\u00a0 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING:\n - Available in tablets and capsules containing 37.5 mg phentermine hydrochloride (equivalent to 30 mg phentermine base).

(5.4)\n - \u2022\u00a0Cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported. (5.5)\n - Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning].\n - The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\n - P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), including clopidogrel, increase the risk of bleeding.\n - P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\n - Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n - Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs)[see Drug Interactions (7.4,7.5,7.6,7.7)].\n - Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved.\n - TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange).

Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning].\n - The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].\n\n5.2 General Risk of Bleeding:\n - P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), including clopidogrel, increase the risk of bleeding.\n - P2Y12 inhibitors (thienopyridines), inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days). Because the half-life of clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.\n - Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers[see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n - Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs)[see Drug Interactions (7.4,7.5,7.6,7.7)].\n\n5.3 Discontinuation of Clopidogrel Tablets:\n - Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved.\n\n5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP):\n - TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\n\n5.5 Cross-Reactivity among Thienopyridines:\n - Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity or hematologic reaction to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (4.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\n\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS:\n - The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling:\n - \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bleeding[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n - \u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura[see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\n - Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction.

No evidence of fetotoxicity was observed when clopidogrel was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses corresponding to 65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose [see Data].\n - The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n - Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk\n - Myocardial infarction and stroke are medical emergencies. Therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of clopidogrel on the fetus.\n - Labor or deliveryClopidogrel use during labor or delivery will increase the risk of maternal bleeding and hemorrhage. Avoid neuraxial blockade during clopidogrel use because of the risk of spinal hematoma. When possible, discontinue clopidogrel 5 to 7 days prior to labor, delivery, or neuraxial blockade.\n - DataHuman dataThe available data from published case reports over two decades of postmarketing use have not identified an association with clopidogrel use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes.\n - Animal dataEmbryo-fetal developmental toxicology studies were performed in pregnant rats and rabbits with doses up to 500 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, administered during organogenesis. These doses, corresponding to 65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose, respectively, on a mg/m2basis, revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to clopidogrel.\n - Risk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of clopidogrel in human milk or the effects on milk production.

Possible factors contributing to this outcome were the dose of clopidogrel, the concomitant administration of aspirin, and the late initiation of therapy following shunt palliation. It cannot be ruled out that a trial with a different design would demonstrate a clinical benefit in this patient population.\n - Of the total number of subjects in the CAPRIE and CURE controlled clinical studies, approximately 50% of patients treated with clopidogrel \u00a0were 65 years of age and older, and 15% were 75 years and older. In COMMIT, approximately 58% of the patients treated with clopidogrel were 60 years and older, 26% of whom were 70 years and older.\n - The observed risk of bleeding events with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Table 1 and Table 2 for the CURE and COMMIT trials, respectively[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients.\n - Experience is limited in patients with severe and moderate renal impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n - No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].\n\n8.1 Pregnancy:\n - Risk SummaryAvailable data from cases reported in published literature and postmarketing surveillance with clopidogrel use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects or miscarriage[see Data].There are risks to the pregnant woman and fetus associated with myocardial infarction and stroke [see Clinical Considerations]. No evidence of fetotoxicity was observed when clopidogrel was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses corresponding to 65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose [see Data].\n - The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n - Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk\n - Myocardial infarction and stroke are medical emergencies. Therapy for the pregnant woman should not be withheld because of potential concerns regarding the effects of clopidogrel on the fetus.\n - Labor or deliveryClopidogrel use during labor or delivery will increase the risk of maternal bleeding and hemorrhage. Avoid neuraxial blockade during clopidogrel use because of the risk of spinal hematoma. When possible, discontinue clopidogrel 5 to 7 days prior to labor, delivery, or neuraxial blockade.\n - DataHuman dataThe available data from published case reports over two decades of postmarketing use have not identified an association with clopidogrel use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse fetal outcomes.\n - Animal dataEmbryo-fetal developmental toxicology studies were performed in pregnant rats and rabbits with doses up to 500 and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively, administered during organogenesis.

The pink film coating contains hypromellose 2910, polyethylene glycol 400, titanium dioxide and iron oxide red.\n\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\n - Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12class of ADP receptors on platelets.\n - Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. This action is irreversible. Consequently, platelets exposed to clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days). Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP.\n - Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of clopidogrel. Repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg clopidogrel per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days.\n - Geriatric Patients\n - Elderly (\u226575 years) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation.\n - Renally Impaired Patients\n - After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL/min) showed low (25%) inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation.\n - Hepatically Impaired Patients\n - After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects.\n - Gender\n - In a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women.\n - Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites.\n - Absorption\n - After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites.\n - Effect of food\n - Clopidogrel tablets can be administered with or without food.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38020, "end_char_idx": 41822, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32a905b6-7e62-4bcf-a044-324085089a79": {"__data__": {"id_": "32a905b6-7e62-4bcf-a044-324085089a79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "27496ed0cdbd305816d9553f5fc3644f2bdd022837c1c380359da7befdef6318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01ba95e8-ceca-46fa-9af3-cf27a64a20bd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "9b16c90e688cf9de763a14315c511a64e91303e44cff6f8c03f5c26987becf02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "619058dc-fee9-4402-886f-235f669e7bd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ebb55206d25d137a10796922714160975341c8f0804ed67d1a2f2342bb4b868", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- Hepatically Impaired Patients\n - After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects.\n - Gender\n - In a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women.\n - Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites.\n - Absorption\n - After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed.

In a study in healthy male subjects when clopidogrel tablet 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC0-24was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was a 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when a clopidogrel tablet 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high-fat breakfast.\n - MetabolismClopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Subsequent metabolism of the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite, a thiol derivative of clopidogrel. The active metabolite is formed mostly by CYP2C19 with contributions from several other CYP enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A. The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet.The Cmaxof the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose. Cmaxoccurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing. In the 75 to 300 mg dose range, the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality: 4-fold the dose results in 2.0-fold and 2.7-fold the Cmaxand AUC, respectively.\n - Elimination\n - Following an oral dose of14C-labeled clopidogrel in humans, approximately 50% of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46% in feces over the 5 days post dosing.

Concomitant administration of repaglinide with clopidogrel increased the systemic exposure to repaglinide (AUC0-\u221e) by 5.1-fold following the loading dose (300 mg) and by 3.9-fold on day 3 of the maintenance dose (75 mg) of clopidogrel [see Drug Interactions (7.8)].\n - CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2-oxo-clopidogrel intermediate metabolite. Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects, as measured byex vivoplatelet aggregation assays, differ according to CYP2C19 genotype. Patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene are termed \u201cCYP2C19 poor metabolizers.\u201d Approximately 2% of White and 4% of Black patients are poor metabolizers; the prevalence of poor metabolism is higher in Asian patients (e.g., 14% of Chinese). Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.A crossover study in 40 healthy subjects, 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metabolizer groups, evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg followed by 75 mg per day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg per day, each for a total of 5 days. Decreased active metabolite exposure and diminished inhibition of platelet aggregation were observed in the poor metabolizers as compared to the other groups.Table 3: Active Metabolite Pharmacokinetics and Antiplatelet Responses by CYP2C19 Metabolizer Status\n\n12.1 Mechanism of Action:\n - Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12class of ADP receptors on platelets.\n\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics:\n - Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. This action is irreversible. Consequently, platelets exposed to clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days). Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP.\n - Dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of clopidogrel.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44134, "end_char_idx": 48113, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31ac8010-5b22-467e-9f54-cb4bed31c072": {"__data__": {"id_": "31ac8010-5b22-467e-9f54-cb4bed31c072", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "27496ed0cdbd305816d9553f5fc3644f2bdd022837c1c380359da7befdef6318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "619058dc-fee9-4402-886f-235f669e7bd0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0ae4b5a71a2f6d2c77181534f6f87fb21899faeeedc224f65d16c9458e1328a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e56872a-1cdb-41a3-bd21-a7d0f199e57f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f07bddc7a153297c1660ebc46b5da666acb3627e37641c5a55259c9c456f26e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "12.2 Pharmacodynamics:\n - Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation.

Repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the first day, and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7. At steady state, the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg clopidogrel per day was between 40% and 60%. Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued, generally in about 5 days.\n - Geriatric Patients\n - Elderly (\u226575 years) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation.\n - Renally Impaired Patients\n - After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day, patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL/min) showed low (25%) inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation.\n - Hepatically Impaired Patients\n - After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment, inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects.\n - Gender\n - In a small study comparing men and women, less inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in women.\n\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics:\n - Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites.\n - Absorption\n - After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day, clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is at least 50%, based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites.\n - Effect of food\n - Clopidogrel tablets can be administered with or without food. In a study in healthy male subjects when clopidogrel tablet 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast, mean inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9%. The active metabolite AUC0-24was unchanged in the presence of food, while there was a 57% decrease in active metabolite Cmax. Similar results were observed when a clopidogrel tablet 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high-fat breakfast.\n - MetabolismClopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways: one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative (85% of circulating metabolites) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to clopidogrel.\n\n14.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome:\n - CURE\n - The CURE study included 12,562 patients with ACS without ST-elevation (UA or NSTEMI) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia. Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (without ST-elevation) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal.\n - Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel tablets (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily) or placebo, and were treated for up to one year. Patients also received aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily) and other standard therapies such as heparin. The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization.The patient population was largely White (82%) and included 38% women, and 52% age \u226565 years of age. Only about 20% of patients underwent revascularization during the initial hospitalization and few underwent emergent or urgent revascularization.\n - The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome (CV death, MI, or stroke) was 582 (9.3%) in the clopidogrel-treated group and 719 (11.4%) in the placebo-treated group, a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI of 10% to 28%; p <0.001) for the clopidogrel-treated group (see Table 4).Table 4: Outcome Events in the CURE Primary Analysis\n - * Other standard therapies were used as appropriate.\u2020 The individual components do not represent a breakdown of the primary and coprimary outcomes, but rather the totalnumber of subjects experiencing an event during the course of the study.\n - Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months)(see Figure 2).\n - Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study\n - The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 63195, "end_char_idx": 67107, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "395ed926-a51d-4145-acaa-caebafdcc5cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "395ed926-a51d-4145-acaa-caebafdcc5cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "27496ed0cdbd305816d9553f5fc3644f2bdd022837c1c380359da7befdef6318", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef16122f-4ea3-48c0-8aa1-4a298a09ca2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_name": "20240731_74af0619-5a87-4718-8d30-7e63cf0fbc69.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 418226, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "9a18c8fbdd3cac71bdfeaa1092531ed9f5e70eb30a62c4f2d7b03cd757b9c418", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1884baf9-8749-4255-b5d4-7102dce3120f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22315ba1625aa1419cef3ef1e4b1f7e52eb6ff607059f7ee6d68716a2f8aaa3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months)(see Figure 2).\n - Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study\n - The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3.\u00a0\u00a0The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily).

The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36.0%] in the clopidogrel group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).\n - COMMIT\n - In patients with STEMI, the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel were evaluated in the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, COMMIT. COMMIT included 45,852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities (i.e., ST-elevation, ST-depression or left bundle-branch block).\n - Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel (75 mg once daily) or placebo, in combination with aspirin (162 mg per day), for 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.\n - The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re-infarction, stroke or death.\n - The patient population\u00a0was 28% women and\u00a058% age \u226560 years (26% age \u226570 years). Fifty-five percent (55%) of patients received thrombolytics and only 3% underwent PCI.\n - As shown in Table 5 and Figure 4 and Figure 5 below, clopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7% (p=0.029), and the relative risk of the combination of re-infarction, stroke or death by 9% (p=0.002).\n - Table 5: Outcome Events in COMMIT\n - Figure 4: Cumulative Event Rates for Death in the COMMIT Study*\n - Figure 5: Cumulative Event Rates for the Combined Endpoint Re-Infarction, Stroke or Death in the COMMIT Study*\n - The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various prespecified subgroups as shown in Figure 6.

Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years).\n - The trial's primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular.Table 6: Outcome Events in the CAPRIE Primary AnalysisPatients\n - As shown in Table 6, clopidogrel was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events\u00a0was lower in the clopidogrel group.\n - The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.\n - Figure 7: Fatal or Nonfatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE StudyThe statistical significance favoring clopidogrel over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of clopidogrel is substantial.\n - The CAPRIE trial enrolled a population that had recent MI, recent stroke, or PAD. The efficacy of clopidogrel relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these subgroups (p=0.043) (see Figure 8). Nonetheless, this difference may be a chance occurrence because the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups. The benefit was most apparent in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral arterial disease and less apparent in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, clopidogrel was not numerically superior to aspirin.Figure 8: Hazard Ratio and 95% CI by Baseline Subgroups in the CAPRIE Study\n\n14.3 No Demonstrated Benefit of Clopidogrel plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease:\n - CHARISMA\n - The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing clopidogrel (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke.

It is available as tablets for oral administration. Each tablet contains 600 mg gemfibrozil USP. Each tablet also contains colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polysorbate 80, pregelatinized starch (botanical source: maize), sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide. The chemical name is 5-(2,5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethylpentanoic acid, with the following structural formula:\n - The empirical formula is C15H22O3and the molecular weight is 250.35; practically insoluble in water, soluble in alcohol, in methanol, and in chloroform. The melting point is 58\u00b0 to 61\u00b0C. Gemfibrozil is a white solid which is stable under ordinary conditions.\n\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\n - Gemfibrozil is a lipid regulating agent which decreases serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and increases high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. While modest decreases in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol may be observed with gemfibrozil therapy, treatment of patients with elevated triglycerides due to Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia often results in a rise in LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol levels in Type IIb patients with elevations of both serum LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are, in general, minimally affected by gemfibrozil treatment; however, gemfibrozil usually raises HDL-cholesterol significantly in this group. Gemfibrozil increases levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions HDL2and HDL3, as well as apolipoproteins AI and AII. Epidemiological studies have shown that both low HDL-cholesterol and high LDL-cholesterol are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.\n - In the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, in which 4081 male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion, gemfibrozil therapy was associated with significant reductions in total plasma triglycerides and a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moderate reductions in total plasma cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed for the gemfibrozil treatment group as a whole, but the lipid response was heterogeneous, especially among different Fredrickson types. The study involved subjects with serum non-HDL-cholesterol of over 200 mg/dL and no previous history of coronary heart disease. Over the five-year study period, the gemfibrozil group experienced a 1.4 % absolute (34 % relative) reduction in the rate of serious coronary events (sudden cardiac deaths plus fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions) compared to placebo, p=0.04 (see Table I). There was a 37 % relative reduction in the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction compared to placebo, equivalent to a treatment-related difference of 13.1 events per thousand persons. Deaths from any cause during the double-blind portion of the study totaled 44 (2.2%) in the gemfibrozil randomization group and 43 (2.1%) in the placebo group.\n - 1lipid values in mg/dL at baseline2P = placebo group; G = Gemfibrozil group3difference in rates between placebo and Gemfibrozil groups4fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions plus sudden cardiac deaths (events per 1000 patients over 5 years)\n - Among Fredrickson types, during the 5-year double-blind portion of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, the greatest reduction in the incidence of serious coronary events occurred in Type IIb patients who had elevations of both LDL-cholesterol and total plasma triglycerides. This subgroup of Type IIb gemfibrozil group patients had a lower mean HDL-cholesterol level at baseline than the Type IIa subgroup that had elevations of LDL-cholesterol and normal plasma triglycerides. The mean increase in HDL-cholesterol among the Type IIb patients in this study was 12.6% compared to placebo.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4030, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0f3e46c-149d-44e7-8994-19d8c4d7c5fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0f3e46c-149d-44e7-8994-19d8c4d7c5fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "6fab3c4cd63c5bfe04d31ae932c1999299e7ab3e7a98ca229361e904a99f3c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bab72927-561f-40b2-8921-1685923080bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "b53c48dba63bd8980f3205530cd677822d1d42872bf42a25e963314e15cb5c4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f3a8da3-cb6c-49a0-9b8e-ef612863d203", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "612d605b9ee751e7820a33382eb44fa77ea36288d0e47459f90225da01019256", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This subgroup of Type IIb gemfibrozil group patients had a lower mean HDL-cholesterol level at baseline than the Type IIa subgroup that had elevations of LDL-cholesterol and normal plasma triglycerides.

The mean change in LDL-cholesterol among Type IIb patients was -4.1% with gemfibrozil compared to a rise of 3.9% in the placebo subgroup. The Type IIb subjects in the Helsinki Heart Study had 26 fewer coronary events per thousand persons over five years in the gemfibrozil group compared to placebo. The difference in coronary events was substantially greater between gemfibrozil and placebo for that subgroup of patients with the triad of LDL-cholesterol >175 mg/dL (>4.5 mmol), triglycerides >200 mg/dL (>2.2 mmol), and HDL-cholesterol <35 mg/dL (<0.90 mmol) (see Table I).\n - Further information is available from a 3.5 year (8.5 year cumulative) follow-up of all subjects who had participated in the Helsinki Heart Study. At the completion of the Helsinki Heart Study, subjects could choose to start, stop, or continue to receive gemfibrozil; without knowledge of their own lipid values or double-blind treatment, 60% of patients originally randomized to placebo began therapy with gemfibrozil and 60% of patients originally randomized to gemfibrozil continued medication. After approximately 6.5 years following randomization, all patients were informed of their original treatment group and lipid values during the five years of the double-blind treatment.

The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was cardiac events (the sum of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions and sudden cardiac deaths). The hazard ratio (gemfibrozil : placebo) for cardiac events was 1.47 (95% confidence limits 0.88 to 2.48, p=0.14). Of the 35 patients in the gemfibrozil group who experienced cardiac events, 12 patients suffered events after discontinuation from the study. Of the 24 patients in the placebo group with cardiac events, 4 patients suffered events after discontinuation from the study. There were 17 cardiac deaths in the gemfibrozil group and 8 in the placebo group (hazard ratio 2.18; 95% confidence limits 0.94 to 5.05, p=0.06). Ten of these deaths in the gemfibrozil group and 3 in the placebo group occurred after discontinuation from therapy. In this study of patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease, no benefit from gemfibrozil treatment was observed in reducing cardiac events or cardiac deaths. Thus, gemfibrozil has shown benefit only in selected dyslipidemic patients without suspected or established coronary heart disease. Even in patients with coronary heart disease and the triad of elevated LDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, plus low HDL-cholesterol, the possible effect of gemfibrozil on coronary events has not been adequately studied.\n - No efficacy in the patients with established coronary heart disease was observed during the Coronary Drug Project with the chemically and pharmacologically related drug, clofibrate. The Coronary Drug Project was a 6-year randomized, double-blind study involving 1000 clofibrate, 1000 nicotinic acid, and 3000 placebo patients with known coronary heart disease. A clinically and statistically significant reduction in myocardial infarctions was seen in the concurrent nicotinic acid group compared to placebo; no reduction was seen with clofibrate.\n - The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil has not been definitely established. In man, gemfibrozil has been shown to inhibit peripheral lipolysis and to decrease the hepatic extraction of free fatty acids, thus reducing hepatic triglyceride production. Gemfibrozil inhibits synthesis and increases clearance of VLDL carrier apolipoprotein B, leading to a decrease in VLDL production.\n - Animal studies suggest that gemfibrozil may, in addition to elevating HDL-cholesterol, reduce incorporation of long-chain fatty acids into newly formed triglycerides, accelerate turnover and removal of cholesterol from the liver, and increase excretion of cholesterol in the feces. Gemfibrozil is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Peak plasma levels occur in 1 to 2 hours with a plasma half-life of 1.5 hours following multiple doses.\n - Gemfibrozil is completely absorbed after oral administration of gemfibrozil tablets, reaching peak plasma concentrations 1 to 2 hours after dosing. Gemfibrozil pharmacokinetics are affected by the timing of meals relative to time of dosing. In one study (ref.4), both the rate and extent of absorption of the drug were significantly increased when administered 0.5 hour before meals. Average AUC was reduced by 14 to 44% when gemfibrozil was administered after meals compared to 0.5 hour before meals. In a subsequent study, rate of absorption of gemfibrozil was maximum when administered 0.5 hour before meals with the Cmax 50 to 60% greater than when given either with meals or fasting. In this study, there were no significant effects on AUC of timing of dose relative to meals (seeDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).Gemfibrozil mainly undergoes oxidation of a ring methyl group to successively form a hydroxymethyl and a carboxyl metabolite.

Excess body weight and excess alcohol intake may be important factors in hypertriglyceridemia and should be managed prior to any drug therapy. Physical exercise can be an important ancillary measure, and has been associated with rises in HDL-cholesterol. Diseases contributory to hyperlipidemia such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus should be looked for and adequately treated. Estrogen therapy is sometimes associated with massive rises in plasma triglycerides, especially in subjects with familial hypertriglyceridemia. In such cases, discontinuation of estrogen therapy may obviate the need for specific drug therapy of hypertriglyceridemia. The use of drugs should be considered only when reasonable attempts have been made to obtain satisfactory results with nondrug methods. If the decision is made to use drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.\n\nWARNINGS:\n - 1. Because of chemical, pharmacological, and clinical similarities between gemfibrozil and clofibrate, the adverse findings with clofibrate in two large clinical studies may also apply to gemfibrozil. In the first of those studies, the Coronary Drug Project, 1000 subjects with previous myocardial infarction were treated for five years with clofibrate. There was no difference in mortality between the clofibrate-treated subjects and 3000 placebo-treated subjects, but twice as many clofibrate-treated subjects developed cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery. In the other study, conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5000 subjects without known coronary heart disease were treated with clofibrate for five years and followed one year beyond. There was a statistically significant (44%) higher age-adjusted total mortality in the clofibrate-treated group than in a comparable placebo-treated control group during the trial period. The excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis. The higher risk of clofibrate-treated subjects for gallbladder disease was confirmed.\n - Because of the more limited size of the Helsinki Heart Study, the observed difference in mortality from any cause between the gemfibrozil and placebo groups is not statistically significantly different from the 29% excess mortality reported in the clofibrate group in the separate WHO study at the nine year follow-up (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Gemfibrozil therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found. Cases of cholelithiasis have been reported with gemfibrozil therapy.\n - 3. Since a reduction of mortality from coronary heart disease has not been demonstrated and because liver and interstitial cell testicular tumors were increased in rats, gemfibrozil should be administered only to those patients described in theINDICATIONS AND USAGEsection. If a significant serum lipid response is not obtained, gemfibrozil should be discontinued.\n - 4. Concomitant Anticoagulants-Caution should be exercised when\u00a0warfarin\u00a0is given in conjunction with gemfibrozil. The dosage of warfarin should be reduced to maintain the prothrombin time at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent prothrombin determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the prothrombin level has stabilized.\n - 5. The concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with simvastatin is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONSandPRECAUTIONS). Concomitant therapy with gemfibrozil and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated with an increased risk of skeletal muscle toxicity manifested as rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels, and myoglobinuria, leading in a high proportion of cases to acute renal failure and death.\u00a0IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN UNSATISFACTORY LIPID RESPONSE TO EITHER DRUG ALONE, THE BENEFIT OF COMBINED THERAPY WITH GEMFIBROZIL AND an HMG-CoA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE RISKS OF SEVERE MYOPATHY, RHABDOMYOLYSIS, AND ACUTE RENAL FAILURE\u00a0(seePRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions). The use of fibrates alone, including gemfibrozil, may occasionally be associated with myositis. Patients receiving gemfibrozil and complaining of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness should have prompt medical evaluation for myositis, including serum creatine-kinase level determination. If myositis is suspected or diagnosed, gemfibrozil therapy should be withdrawn.\n - 6. Cataracts - Subcapsular bilateral cataracts occurred in 10%, and unilateral in 6.3%, of male rats treated with gemfibrozil at 10 times the human dose.7. CYP2C8 substrates - Gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, may increase exposure of CYP2C8 substrates when administered concomitantly (seePRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions).8. OATP1B1 substrates \u2013 Gemfibrozil is an inhibitor of organic anion-transporter polyprotein (OATP) 1B1 and may increase exposure of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g., atrasentan, atorvastatin, bosentan, ezetimibe, fluvastatin, glyburide, SN-38 [active metabolite of irinotecan], rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rifampin, valsartan, olmesartan). Therefore, dosing reductions of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 may be required when gemfibrozil is used concomitantly (seePRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 17752, "end_char_idx": 21319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01ea925f-3b04-447f-93e0-c0ee56b5ea41": {"__data__": {"id_": "01ea925f-3b04-447f-93e0-c0ee56b5ea41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "6fab3c4cd63c5bfe04d31ae932c1999299e7ab3e7a98ca229361e904a99f3c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "605fd6ae-5973-414d-bd28-ff054cbcb348", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "b8975453417e0ffcd6975ebe9ffcf1a052f6aae67e4a99a4c0c82d92494a003c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "231a8a8e-9807-49b7-9aad-1b0cf6e0a60b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "57dfa94bbeea3e599cfb18e1b0396beace3d536010648ddb0fbac55b8c3670bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "OATP1B1 substrates \u2013 Gemfibrozil is an inhibitor of organic anion-transporter polyprotein (OATP) 1B1 and may increase exposure of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g., atrasentan, atorvastatin, bosentan, ezetimibe, fluvastatin, glyburide, SN-38 [active metabolite of irinotecan], rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rifampin, valsartan, olmesartan). Therefore, dosing reductions of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1 may be required when gemfibrozil is used concomitantly (seePRECAUTIONS,Drug Interactions). Combination therapy of gemfibrozil with simvastatin or with repaglinide, which are OATP1B1 substrates, is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\n\nPRECAUTIONS:\n - Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that the lipid levels are consistently abnormal. Before instituting gemfibrozil therapy, every attempt should be made to control serum lipids with appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that are contributing to the lipid abnormalities.\n - Periodic determination of serum lipids should be obtained, and the drug withdrawn if lipid response is inadequate after three months of therapy.\n - The concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with simvastatin is contraindicated ( seeCONTRAINDICATIONSandWARNINGS). Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, initiate rosuvastatin at 5 mg once daily. The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with combined gemfibrozil and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy. Myopathy or rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure have been reported as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy or after several months\u00a0(seeWARNINGS). There is no assurance that periodic monitoring of creatine kinase will prevent the occurrence of severe myopathy and kidney damage.\n - CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN WARFARIN\u00a0IS GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEMFIBROZIL. THE DOSAGE OF WARFARIN SHOULD BE REDUCED TO MAINTAIN THE PROTHROMBIN TIME AT THE DESIRED LEVEL TO PREVENT BLEEDING COMPLICATIONS. FREQUENT PROTHROMBIN DETERMINATIONS ARE ADVISABLE UNTIL IT HAS BEEN DEFINITELY DETERMINED THAT THE PROTHROMBIN LEVEL HAS STABILIZED.\n - Gemfibrozil is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 and may increase exposure of drugs mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., dabrafenib, enzalutamide, loperamide, montelukast, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone). Therefore, dosing reduction of drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP2C8 enzyme may be required when gemfibrozil is used concomitantly (seeWARNINGS).Repaglinide:In healthy volunteers, co-administration with gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily for 3 days) resulted in an 8.1-fold (range 5.5- to 15.0- fold) higher repaglinide AUC and a 28.6-fold (range 18.5- to 80.1-fold) higher repaglinide plasma concentration 7 hours after the dose. In the same study, gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily for 3 days) + itraconazole (200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening at Day 1, then 100 mg twice daily at Day 2-3) resulted in a 19.4- (range 12.9- to 24.7-fold) higher repaglinide AUC and a 70.4-fold (range 42.9- to 119.2-fold) higher repaglinide plasma concentration 7 hours after the dose.

Co-administration of gemfibrozil and repaglinide increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia and is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).Dasabuvir:Co-administration of gemfibrozil with dasabuvir increased dasabuvir AUC and Cmax(ratios: 11.3 and 2.01, respectively) due to CYP2C8 inhibition. Increased dasabuvir exposure may increase the risk of QT prolongation, therefore, coadministration of gemfibrozil with dasabuvir is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\n - Selexipag:Co-administration of gemfibrozil with selexipag doubled exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11-fold. Concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with selexipag is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\n - Enzalutamide:In healthy volunteers given a single 160 mg dose of enzalutamide after gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, the AUC of enzalutamide plus active metabolite (N-desmethyl enzalutamide) was increased by 2.2 fold and corresponding Cmaxwas decreased by 16%.

Caution should be excercised when prescribing gemfibrozil with colchicine, especially in elderly patients or patients with renal dysfunction.\n - Long-term studies have been conducted in rats at 0.2 and 1.3 times the human exposure (based on AUC). The incidence of benign liver nodules and liver carcinomas was significantly increased in high dose male rats. The incidence of liver carcinomas increased also in low dose males, but this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.1). Male rats had a dose-related and statistically significant increase of benign Leydig cell tumors. The higher dose female rats had a significant increase in the combined incidence of benign and malignant liver neoplasms.\n - Long-term studies have been conducted in mice at 0.1 and 0.7 times the human exposure (based on AUC). There were no statistically significant differences from controls in the incidence of liver tumors, but the doses tested were lower than those shown to be carcinogenic with other fibrates.Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated a florid hepatic peroxisome proliferation following gemfibrozil administration to the male rat. An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation has not been done in humans but changes in peroxisome morphology have been observed. Peroxisome proliferation has been shown to occur in humans with either of two other drugs of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.\n - Administration of approximately 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) to male rats for 10 weeks resulted in a dose-related decrease of fertility. Subsequent studies demonstrated that this effect was reversed after a drug-free period of about eight weeks, and it was not transmitted to the offspring.\n - Gemfibrozil has been shown to produce adverse effects in rats and rabbits at doses between 0.5 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Gemfibrozil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n - Administration of gemfibrozil to female rats at 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) before and throughout gestation caused a dose-related decrease in conception rate, an increase in stillborns and a slight reduction in pup weight during lactation. There were also dose-related increased skeletal variations. Anophthalmia occurred, but rarely.\n - Administration of 0.6 and 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil to female rats from gestation day 15 through weaning caused dose-related decreases in birth weight and suppressions of pup growth during lactation.\n - Administration of 1 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil to female rabbits during organogenesis caused a dose-related decrease in litter size and, at the high dose, an increased incidence of parietal bone variations.\n - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for gemfibrozil in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n - Mild hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in occasional patients following initiation of gemfibrozil therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Rarely, severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow hypoplasia have been reported.

Initial Therapy:\n - Laboratory studies should be done to ascertain that the lipid levels are consistently abnormal. Before instituting gemfibrozil therapy, every attempt should be made to control serum lipids with appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that are contributing to the lipid abnormalities.\n\n2. Continued Therapy:\n - Periodic determination of serum lipids should be obtained, and the drug withdrawn if lipid response is inadequate after three months of therapy.\n\n3. Drug Interactions:\n - The concomitant administration of gemfibrozil with simvastatin is contraindicated ( seeCONTRAINDICATIONSandWARNINGS). Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, initiate rosuvastatin at 5 mg once daily. The dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily.

Combination therapy of gemfibrozil with simvastatin or with repaglinide, which are OATP1B1 substrates, is contraindicated (seeCONTRAINDICATIONS).\n\n(E) In vitro studies of CYP enzymes, UGTA enzymes and OATP1B1 transporter::\n - In vitro studies have shown that gemfibrozil is an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, OATP1B1, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and 1A3 (seeWARNINGS).\n\n(F) Bile Acid-Binding Resins::\n - Gemfibrozil AUC was reduced by 30% when gemfibrozil was given (600 mg) simultaneously with resin-granule drugs such as colestipol (5 g). Administration of the drugs two hours or more apart is recommended because gemfibrozil exposure was not significantly affected when it was administered two hours apart from colestipol.\n\n(G) Colchicine:\n - Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, has been reported with chronic administration of colchicine at therapeutic doses. Concomitant use of gemfibrozil may potentiate the development of myopathy. Patients with renal dysfunction and elderly patients are at increased risk. Caution should be excercised when prescribing gemfibrozil with colchicine, especially in elderly patients or patients with renal dysfunction.\n\n4.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38547, "end_char_idx": 41839, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "626200ce-79a7-471e-8080-d08cb6004b8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "626200ce-79a7-471e-8080-d08cb6004b8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "6fab3c4cd63c5bfe04d31ae932c1999299e7ab3e7a98ca229361e904a99f3c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "002f6f72-cb81-4d43-b1a5-7334b4e0a3b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "583853df33212db7830fbfea9f92e9b7705336002b65cfdb584120d7e39f16c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4a4ef05-3371-486c-8868-5b661a5d41b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "09bf1e51eec82a8a824ff29feeb2a265fb58351ba72829ca16343b466f910a30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(F) Bile Acid-Binding Resins::\n - Gemfibrozil AUC was reduced by 30% when gemfibrozil was given (600 mg) simultaneously with resin-granule drugs such as colestipol (5 g).

Caution should be excercised when prescribing gemfibrozil with colchicine, especially in elderly patients or patients with renal dysfunction.\n\n4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:\n - Long-term studies have been conducted in rats at 0.2 and 1.3 times the human exposure (based on AUC). The incidence of benign liver nodules and liver carcinomas was significantly increased in high dose male rats. The incidence of liver carcinomas increased also in low dose males, but this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.1). Male rats had a dose-related and statistically significant increase of benign Leydig cell tumors. The higher dose female rats had a significant increase in the combined incidence of benign and malignant liver neoplasms.\n - Long-term studies have been conducted in mice at 0.1 and 0.7 times the human exposure (based on AUC). There were no statistically significant differences from controls in the incidence of liver tumors, but the doses tested were lower than those shown to be carcinogenic with other fibrates.Electron microscopy studies have demonstrated a florid hepatic peroxisome proliferation following gemfibrozil administration to the male rat. An adequate study to test for peroxisome proliferation has not been done in humans but changes in peroxisome morphology have been observed. Peroxisome proliferation has been shown to occur in humans with either of two other drugs of the fibrate class when liver biopsies were compared before and after treatment in the same individual.\n - Administration of approximately 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) to male rats for 10 weeks resulted in a dose-related decrease of fertility. Subsequent studies demonstrated that this effect was reversed after a drug-free period of about eight weeks, and it was not transmitted to the offspring.\n\n5. Pregnancy:\n - Gemfibrozil has been shown to produce adverse effects in rats and rabbits at doses between 0.5 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Gemfibrozil should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.\n - Administration of gemfibrozil to female rats at 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) before and throughout gestation caused a dose-related decrease in conception rate, an increase in stillborns and a slight reduction in pup weight during lactation. There were also dose-related increased skeletal variations. Anophthalmia occurred, but rarely.\n - Administration of 0.6 and 2 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil to female rats from gestation day 15 through weaning caused dose-related decreases in birth weight and suppressions of pup growth during lactation.\n - Administration of 1 and 3 times the human dose (based on surface area) of gemfibrozil to female rabbits during organogenesis caused a dose-related decrease in litter size and, at the high dose, an increased incidence of parietal bone variations.\n\n6. Nursing Mothers:\n - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for gemfibrozil in animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\n\n7. Hematologic Changes:\n - Mild hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in occasional patients following initiation of gemfibrozil therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Rarely, severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow hypoplasia have been reported.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 41049, "end_char_idx": 45444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4a4ef05-3371-486c-8868-5b661a5d41b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4a4ef05-3371-486c-8868-5b661a5d41b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "6fab3c4cd63c5bfe04d31ae932c1999299e7ab3e7a98ca229361e904a99f3c2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "626200ce-79a7-471e-8080-d08cb6004b8a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75cac02c-56e3-4dfe-b1e2-4ce166b28833.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 110488, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "3c454298b5d098ef6df3d0870ae38cdd4fcb20926fd8c921d313855185dde097", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "487111b6-0e09-4114-8117-20238fa0e2c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1c8f3e8c5d2df6fb1b342eaa0346e7bcdc06e1d9ab2f9a18babac69c3c9b67a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "6.

Hematologic Changes:\n - Mild hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in occasional patients following initiation of gemfibrozil therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Rarely, severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow hypoplasia have been reported. Therefore, periodic blood counts are recommended during the first 12 months of gemfibrozil administration.\n\n8. Liver Function:\n - Abnormal liver function tests have been observed occasionally during gemfibrozil administration, including elevations of AST, ALT, LDH, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. These are usually reversible when gemfibrozil is discontinued. Therefore, periodic liver function studies are recommended and gemfibrozil therapy should be terminated if abnormalities persist.\n\n9. Kidney Function:\n - There have been reports of worsening renal insufficiency upon the addition of gemfibrozil therapy in individuals with baseline plasma creatinine >2.0 mg/dL. In such patients, the use of alternative therapy should be considered against the risks and benefits of a lower dose of gemfibrozil.\n\n10. Pediatric Use:\n - Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\nADVERSE REACTIONS:\n - In the double-blind controlled phase of the primary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study, 2046 patients received gemfibrozil for up to five years. In that study, the following adverse reactions were statistically more frequent in subjects in the gemfibrozil group:\n - Gallbladder surgerywas performed in 0.9% of gemfibrozil and 0.5% of placebo subjects in the primary prevention component, a 64% excess, which is not statistically different from the excess of gallbladder surgery observed in the clofibrate group compared to the placebo group of the WHO study. Gallbladder surgery was also performed more frequently in the gemfibrozil group compared to the placebo group\u00a0(1.9%\u00a0versus 0.3%, p=0.07) in the secondary prevention component. A statistically significant increase in appendectomy in the gemfibrozil group was seen also in the secondary prevention component (6 on gemfibrozil\u00a0versus 0 on placebo, p=0.014).\n - Nervous system and special senses adverse reactions were more common in the gemfibrozil group. These included hypesthesia, paresthesias, and taste perversion. Other adverse reactions that were more common among gemfibrozil treatment group subjects but where a causal relationship was not established include cataracts, peripheral vascular disease, and intracerebral hemorrhage.\n - From other studies it seems probable that gemfibrozil is causally related to the occurrence of MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS (seeWARNINGS), and to ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS and HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES (seePRECAUTIONS).\n - Reports of viral and bacterial infections (common cold, cough, urinary tract infections) were more common in gemfibrozil treated patients in other controlled clinical trials of 805 patients.

The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4[seeClinical Studies (14.3)]. Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected.\n - If feasible, discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\n - Endometrial Cancer\n - An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n - Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n - Breast Cancer\n - The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80)5[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16142, "end_char_idx": 20127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0af02d91-b0e9-4eaf-8eaa-fe973d7288ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "0af02d91-b0e9-4eaf-8eaa-fe973d7288ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "e7e0d90beec4e15160d03cc9d9c7b87575595c6e6ad6ee9a65becc99ad32c84f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a802601-f3fd-48f1-9303-0c457d54dfdf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "c1383920d240a8e83cf73ce5f51460463277017176831f23bfaac3d5fc0dfc32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a3ba147-9bed-43bd-8e48-fe50dd9de3c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb133119f2823d8bb49aa94d6554d3b4a409e162f1cba35f57ca73559ab2a3bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose.

The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n - The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n - Ovarian Cancer\n - The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% CI, 0.77 to 3.24), but it was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7\n - A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.

The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.\n - In the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.

Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in the HERS, the HERS II, and overall.\n - Venous Thromboembolism\n - In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3[seeClinical Studies (14.3)]. \u00a0Immediately discontinue estrogen-alone therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected.\n - The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE \u00a0in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4[seeClinical Studies (14.3)]. Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected.\n - If feasible, discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\n\n5.2 Malignant Neoplasms:\n - Endometrial Cancer\n - An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n - Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important.

There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n - Breast Cancer\n - The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80)5[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo.\n - In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26% of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n - The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n - Ovarian Cancer\n - The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 18581, "end_char_idx": 23023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ef71a06-1624-48a6-b85a-106002abe8e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ef71a06-1624-48a6-b85a-106002abe8e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "e7e0d90beec4e15160d03cc9d9c7b87575595c6e6ad6ee9a65becc99ad32c84f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1856475-7385-40a2-a4db-4c0d44405430", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "9dd799a8dedad57a27f383bb120de8e656b3164bbf895fcd8180dc866fdb29b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d792d6c4-4b49-4509-88bb-96e507cdf0f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61f506c5d0a0393c5f3b8b06aa385ae88de3cb4a1cd33053a0bbccc3c9b734ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy.

After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% CI, 0.77 to 3.24), but it was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7\n - A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.\n\n5.3 Probable Dementia:\n - In the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].\n - In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].\n - When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.19 to 2.60).

Discontinue estrogens, including DOTTI, if hypercalcemia occurs, and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level.\n\n5.6 Visual Abnormalities:\n - Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue DOTTI pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Permanently discontinue estrogens, including DOTTI, if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions.\n\n5.7 Addition of a\u00a0Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy:\n - Studies of the addition of a progestogenfor 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure:\n - In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.\n\n5.9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia:\n - In women with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.\u00a0Discontinue DOTTI if pancreatitis occurs.\n\n5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice:\n - Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. \u00a0Exercise caution in any woman with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy. In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice, discontinue DOTTI.\n\n5.11 Exacerbation\nof Hypothyroidism:\n - Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy.\u00a0Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with DOTTI to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n5.12 Fluid Retention:\n - Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention.

Consider the addition of progestogen therapy for women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy.\n\n5.15 Severe Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoid Reactions and Angioedema:\n - A few cases of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions are reported in the postmarketing use of DOTTI. Involvement of skin (hives, pruritus, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) are noted.\n - Angioedema involving eye/eyelid, face, larynx, pharynx, tongue and extremity (hands, legs, ankles, and fingers) with or without urticaria requiring medical intervention are reported in the postmarketing use of DOTTI. Angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx, may result in airway obstruction.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n - Genitourinary System\n - Vaginal hemorrhage and abnormal withdrawal bleeding or flow, breakthrough bleeding, spotting, uterine leiomyomata, vaginitis, vaginal discharge, ovarian cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, dysmenorrhea.\n - Breast\n - Enlargement, pain, nipple discharge, fibrocystic breast changes, breast cancer.\n - Cardiovascular\n - Deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thrombophlebitis.\n - Gastrointestinal\n - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, cholelithiasis, liver function tests abnormal, diarrhea.\n - Skin\n - Application site reactions include localized bleeding, bruising, burning, discomfort, dryness, eczema, edema, erythema, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, inflammation, irritation, pain, papules and vesicles. Other skin reactions include paresthesia, skin discoloration, skin pigmentation, urticaria, swelling, loss of scalp hair, hirsutism, pruritus, and rash.\n - Eyes\n - Intolerance to contact lenses.\n - Central Nervous System\n - Migraine, dizziness, chorea, nervousness, affect liability, irritability.\n - Miscellaneous\n - Decrease in weight, reduced carbohydrate tolerance, edema, arthralgias, leg cramps, changes in libido, purpura, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema.\n\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS:\n - In vitroandin vivostudies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in adverse reactions.\n - Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration.

There are no data with the use of DOTTI in pregnant women; however, epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives (estrogen and progestins) before conception or during early pregnancy.\n - In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n - Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast-feeding women. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established.\n - The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for DOTTI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DOTTI or from the underlying maternal condition.\n - DOTTI is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population.\n - If estrogen is administered to patients whose bone growth is not complete, periodic monitoring of bone maturation and effects on epiphyseal centers is recommended during estrogen administration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 55811, "end_char_idx": 59898, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "198634d5-a3a2-4048-8324-ef9ddadac802": {"__data__": {"id_": "198634d5-a3a2-4048-8324-ef9ddadac802", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "e7e0d90beec4e15160d03cc9d9c7b87575595c6e6ad6ee9a65becc99ad32c84f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0bfae1b-4247-4dd0-9adc-19d9d7a0008d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "55b5417ace4eed9b68a9f35c4d1bb75b272729d4d88262ddf36d4e881299c584", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "241382c7-c1ee-41e7-9eb8-52f2d4381db4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a88c8bfea507abfde0ffe08bf23bac3cfb2613b4905b0af555403059a77a663a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n - Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast-feeding women.

Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of DOTTI therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.\n\n11 DESCRIPTION:\n - DOTTI (estradiol transdermal system, USP) contains estradiol, USP in a multipolymeric adhesive. The system is designed to release estradiol, USP continuously upon application to intact skin.\n - Five dosage strengths of DOTTI are available to provide nominalin vivodelivery rates of 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.075, or 0.1 mg of estradiol, USP per day via the skin. Each corresponding system has an active surface area of 1.89, 2.83, 3.78, 5.66, or 7.55 cm2and contains 0.314, 0.470, 0.627, 0.940, or 1.253 mg of estradiol USP, respectively. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical.\n - Estradiol, USP is a white to practically white powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5 (10)- triene-3,17\u03b2-diol.\n - The structural formula is:\n - The molecular formula of estradiol, USP is C18H2402. The molecular weight is 272.39 g/mol.\n - DOTTI is comprised of 3 layers.

These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pg/mL above baseline following application to the abdomen; slightly higher mean levels of 88 pg/mL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pg/mL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pg/mL for the buttocks.

Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.\n - Metabolism\n - Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver by Cytochrome 450 isoforms CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Estradiol undergoes further metabolism to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. Estradiol and its metabolites are glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\n - Excretion\n - Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The half-life values calculated after dosing with DOTTI ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours.\n - Adhesion\n - Based on combined data from 3 short-term clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85% of DOTTI adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5-day wear period. Three percent (3%) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5-day wear period. Approximately 80% of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were DOTTI 0.05 mg per day.\n\n12.1 Mechanism of Action:\n - Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.\n - The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues.

Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.\n - Metabolism\n - Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens. Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions. These transformations take place mainly in the liver by Cytochrome 450 isoforms CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Estradiol undergoes further metabolism to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. Estradiol and its metabolites are glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite. Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption. In postmenopausal women a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.\n - Excretion\n - Estradiol, estrone and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The half-life values calculated after dosing with DOTTI ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours.\n - Adhesion\n - Based on combined data from 3 short-term clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85% of DOTTI adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5-day wear period. Three percent (3%) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5-day wear period. Approximately 80% of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were DOTTI 0.05 mg per day.\n\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY:\n - Long-term, continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:\n - Long-term, continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast, uterus, cervix, vagina, testis, and liver.\n\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES:\n - In a pharmacokinetic study, DOTTI was shown to be bioequivalent to the original estradiol formulation. In 2 controlled clinical trials with the original estradiol formulation, of 356 women, the 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at Week 4, and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. In this original study, the 0.0375 and 0.05 mg doses, however, did not differ from placebo until approximately Week 6, therefore, an additional 12-week, placebo-controlled study in 255 women was performed with the original estradiol formulation to establish the efficacy of the lowest dose of 0.0375 mg.

Two hundred thirty-two (89%) of randomized women (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Women were given supplemental dietary calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium/day) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all the original estradiol formulation dose groups; in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients. All estradiol doses were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at all time points with the exception of estradiol 0.05 mg/day at 6 months.

Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)andUse in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n - The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47% were age 65 to 69 years of age; 35% were 70 to 74 years of age; 18% were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 4 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia as defined in this study included AD, VaD, and mixed type (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)andUse in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n - When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.19 to 2.60). Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.3)andUse in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n14.1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms\u00a0in Postmenopausal Women:\n - In a pharmacokinetic study, DOTTI was shown to be bioequivalent to the original estradiol formulation. In 2 controlled clinical trials with the original estradiol formulation, of 356 women, the 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at Week 4, and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. In this original study, the 0.0375 and 0.05 mg doses, however, did not differ from placebo until approximately Week 6, therefore, an additional 12-week, placebo-controlled study in 255 women was performed with the original estradiol formulation to establish the efficacy of the lowest dose of 0.0375 mg. The baseline mean daily number of hot flushes in these 255 women was 11.5. Results at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 of treatment are shown in Figure 2.\n - Figure 2. Mean (SD) Change from Baseline in Mean Daily Number of Flushes for Estradiol 0.0375 mg Versus Placebo in a 12-week Trial\n - The 0.0375 mg dose was superior to placebo in reducing both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms at Week 4 and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. All doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.0375 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.075 mg, and 0.1 mg) are effective for the control of vasomotor symptoms.\n\n14.2 Effects on Bone Mineral Density\u00a0in Postmenopausal Women:\n - Efficacy and safety of the original estradiol formulation in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied in a 2-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 91343, "end_char_idx": 95127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e387651c-882f-405f-8b67-5ac483feeddc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e387651c-882f-405f-8b67-5ac483feeddc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "e7e0d90beec4e15160d03cc9d9c7b87575595c6e6ad6ee9a65becc99ad32c84f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d9d4431-737f-4e08-a041-021dd05fdf23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_name": "20240731_75fc6d3a-49b6-47ad-b704-410692010d3a.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680615, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "9986f45524f9e548a2d6724cbee8ebab135cbb202230c33495773f94e3a9a9b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43dd6e9e-4e59-49a9-bf33-492e50be2c35", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a09ce3364db4e640470b9d444711390ebfb49cc0013dc6741efd6573f364e9d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- Figure 2.

A total of 261 hysterectomized (161) and non-hysterectomized (100), surgically or naturally menopausal women (within 5 years of menopause), with no evidence of osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density within 2 standard deviations of average peak bone mass, i.e., at least 0.827 g/cm2) were enrolled in this study; 194 women were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.1, 0.05, 0.0375, or 0.025 mg/day) and 67 patients to placebo. Over 2 years, study systems were applied to the buttock or the abdomen twice a week. Non-hysterectomized women received oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/day) throughout the study.\n - The study population comprised naturally (82%) or surgically (18%) menopausal, hysterectomized (61%) or non-hysterectomized (39%) women with a mean age of 52 years (range 27 to 62 years); the mean duration of menopause was 31.7 months (range 2 to 72 months). Two hundred thirty-two (89%) of randomized women (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Women were given supplemental dietary calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium/day) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all the original estradiol formulation dose groups; in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients. All estradiol doses were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at all time points with the exception of estradiol 0.05 mg/day at 6 months. The highest dose of estradiol was superior to the 3 lower doses. There were no statistically significant differences in pairwise comparisons among the 3 lower doses (See Figure 3).\n - Figure 3. Bone Mineral Density-AP Lumbar Spine Least Squares Means of Percentage Change from Baseline All Randomized Patients with at Least One Post-baseline Assessment Available with Last Post-baseline Observation Carried Forward\n - Analysis of percent change from baseline in femoral neck BMD, a secondary efficacy outcome variable, showed qualitatively similar results; all doses of the original estradiol formulation were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at 24 months. The highest estradiol dose was superior to placebo at all time points. A mixture of significant and nonsignificant results were obtained for the lower dose groups at earlier time points. The highest estradiol dose was superior to the 3 lower doses, and there were no significant differences among the 3 lower doses at this skeletal site (See Figure 4).\n - Figure 4.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.\n - WHI Estrogen-Alone Substudy\n - The WHI estrogen-alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed, and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risks and benefits of estrogen-alone in predetermined primary endpoints.

The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the \u201cchange of life\u201d or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes \u201csurgical menopause.\u201d\n - When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating (\u201chot flashes\u201d or \u201chot flushes\u201d). In some women the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.\n - You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DOTTI to control these problems. If you use DOTTI only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.\n - Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use DOTTI to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you.You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue treatment with DOTTI.\n - Who should not useDOTTI? Do not start usingDOTTI if you:\n - Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.\n - Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus (womb). If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use DOTTI.\n - See the list of ingredients in DOTTI at the end of this leaflet.\n - Before you useDOTTI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\n - Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis, lupus, angioedema (swelling of face and tongue); problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood.\n - Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop using DOTTI.\n - DOTTI is not for pregnant women.\n - The hormone in DOTTI can pass into your breast milk.\n - Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how DOTTI works. DOTTI may also affect how your other medicines work.

Generally, a woman without a uterus does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.2,5.14)].\n - Use estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.

The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3[seeClinical Studies (14.3)]. \u00a0Immediately discontinue estrogen-alone therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected.\n - The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE \u00a0in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4[seeClinical Studies (14.3)]. Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected.\n - If feasible, discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.\n - Endometrial Cancer\n - An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n - Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n - Breast Cancer\n - The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80)5[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16142, "end_char_idx": 20127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3409670f-54f0-4141-9e8b-07e36c1cd955": {"__data__": {"id_": "3409670f-54f0-4141-9e8b-07e36c1cd955", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd2cc95b-a570-404c-bf31-0aab023bf806", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "81027dcc6dc75658a57d01603fdd5fa22ef39149d6213810440a7c96b1c20948", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b31116e6-b34a-41f7-aadb-d41a32c62b66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb133119f2823d8bb49aa94d6554d3b4a409e162f1cba35f57ca73559ab2a3bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose.

The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n - The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.\n - Ovarian Cancer\n - The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% CI, 0.77 to 3.24), but it was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7\n - A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.

During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open-label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in the HERS, the HERS II, and overall.\n - Venous Thromboembolism\n - In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE) was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years).

The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.\n - Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important.

Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.\n - Breast Cancer\n - The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer (relative risk [RR] 0.80)5[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo.\n - In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26% of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade, and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6[seeClinical Studies (14.3)].\n - Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.\n - The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation.

The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7\n - A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.\n\n5.3 Probable Dementia:\n - In the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95% CI, 0.83 to 2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].\n - In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.\n - After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].\n - When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.19 to 2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 39358, "end_char_idx": 43369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1479922d-b952-408e-a98f-3e2cc996a052": {"__data__": {"id_": "1479922d-b952-408e-a98f-3e2cc996a052", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a44b537-01ad-4847-93ae-fe9db9da2471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "aec1a3e9199b99b59bd127882e015195e552fafa489fd8f0125c12d7e7c501b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a5a64ed-e92a-4180-9c18-eb0efdff6fa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cfac6853dc92763ba43f6cd12a72eee192a686347d1de8749fd78dc0a314f792", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48).

Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8[seeUse in Specific Populations (8.5),andClinical Studies (14.4)].\n\n5.4 Gallbladder Disease:\n - A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.\n\n5.5 Hypercalcemia:\n - Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. Discontinue estrogens, including DOTTI, if hypercalcemia occurs, and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level.\n\n5.6 Visual Abnormalities:\n - Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue DOTTI pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Permanently discontinue estrogens, including DOTTI, if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions.\n\n5.7 Addition of a\u00a0Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy:\n - Studies of the addition of a progestogenfor 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure:\n - In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.\n\n5.9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia:\n - In women with preexisting hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.\u00a0Discontinue DOTTI if pancreatitis occurs.\n\n5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice:\n - Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. \u00a0Exercise caution in any woman with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy. In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice, discontinue DOTTI.\n\n5.11 Exacerbation\nof Hypothyroidism:\n - Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy.\u00a0Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with DOTTI to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n5.12 Fluid Retention:\n - Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Monitor any woman with a condition(s) that might predispose her to fluid retention, such as cardiac or renal impairment. Discontinue estrogen-alone therapy, including DOTTI, with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention.\n\n5.13 Hypocalcemia:\n - Estrogen induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy, including DOTTI, outweigh the risks in such women.\n\n5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis:\n - A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 42613, "end_char_idx": 46915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a5a64ed-e92a-4180-9c18-eb0efdff6fa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a5a64ed-e92a-4180-9c18-eb0efdff6fa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1479922d-b952-408e-a98f-3e2cc996a052", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "cee16217f70a68f01248112ec13e9a3916d575b69e32cb9536c4691293e70692", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cb43227-f400-4378-845e-386108f9de31", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c203ac02bfae9f536379c14f67c7bd711484c5eaea8d3146a5f80605d260684a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with DOTTI to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.\n\n5.12 Fluid Retention:\n - Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention.

Involvement of skin (hives, pruritus, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) are noted.\n - Angioedema involving eye/eyelid, face, larynx, pharynx, tongue and extremity (hands, legs, ankles, and fingers) with or without urticaria requiring medical intervention are reported in the postmarketing use of DOTTI. Angioedema involving the tongue, glottis, or larynx, may result in airway obstruction. Do not give DOTTI to any woman who develops angioedema during treatment with DOTTI.\n - Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.\n - Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women.\n\n5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions:\n - Estrogen therapy, including DOTTI, may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraines, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women.\n\n5.17 Laboratory Tests:\n - Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.\n - Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding dosage for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration and primary ovarian failure.\n\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS:\n - The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling:\n - The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) with DOTTI are: headache, breast tenderness, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, sinus headache, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, depression, and irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting.

Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in adverse reactions.\n - Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration. (7)\n\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS:\n - Risk Summary\n - DOTTI is not indicated for use in pregnancy.

Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of DOTTI therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care.\n\n11 DESCRIPTION:\n - DOTTI (estradiol transdermal system, USP) contains estradiol, USP in a multipolymeric adhesive. The system is designed to release estradiol, USP continuously upon application to intact skin.\n - Five dosage strengths of DOTTI are available to provide nominalin vivodelivery rates of 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.075, or 0.1 mg of estradiol, USP per day via the skin. Each corresponding system has an active surface area of 1.89, 2.83, 3.78, 5.66, or 7.55 cm2and contains 0.314, 0.470, 0.627, 0.940, or 1.253 mg of estradiol USP, respectively. The composition of the systems per unit area is identical.\n - Estradiol, USP is a white to practically white powder, chemically described as estra-1,3,5 (10)- triene-3,17\u03b2-diol.\n - The structural formula is:\n - The molecular formula of estradiol, USP is C18H2402. The molecular weight is 272.39 g/mol.\n - DOTTI is comprised of 3 layers. Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin, these layers are (1) polyester and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer film (2) an adhesive formulation containing estradiol USP, acrylic adhesive, silicone adhesive, oleyl alcohol, NF, povidone, USP and dipropylene glycol, and (3) a polyester release liner which is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the system can be used.\n - The active component of the system is estradiol, USP. The remaining components of the system are pharmacologically inactive.\n - FDA approved acceptance criteria for dissolution test specifications differ from USP.\n\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\n - Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 62312, "end_char_idx": 66246, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4871df5a-112e-4f49-b0e3-2626276299a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4871df5a-112e-4f49-b0e3-2626276299a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a4fed89-eb91-4bdd-8b1e-1a617b5a4e3f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "7848be5ae20690145f7b628cd34cea22d6b48c529c7f785ae435b741975478ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a24f2e2-d005-48cc-9e0b-3d23a0a072d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "395f3faab3795d51a0413e2ac02015de6f86eb552bbfe8e18b0ba644c5545784", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- The active component of the system is estradiol, USP. The remaining components of the system are pharmacologically inactive.\n - FDA approved acceptance criteria for dissolution test specifications differ from USP.\n\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\n - Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.\n - The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.\n - Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, 2 estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.\n - Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.\n - Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to DOTTI nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.\n - Absorption\n - In a multiple-dose study consisting of 3 consecutive system applications of the original formulation of estradiol transdermal system which was conducted in 17 healthy, postmenopausal women, blood levels of estradiol and estrone were compared following application of these units to sites on the abdomen and buttocks in a crossover fashion. Systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 0.0375 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day were applied to abdominal application sites while the 0.1 mg per day doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks. These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pg/mL above baseline following application to the abdomen; slightly higher mean levels of 88 pg/mL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pg/mL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pg/mL for the buttocks. While plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above baseline at 12 hours following removal of the systems in this study, results from another study show these levels to return to baseline values within 24 hours following removal of the systems.\n - Figure 1 illustrates the mean plasma concentrations of estradiol at steady-state during application of these patches at 4 different dosages.\n - Figure 1.

The half-life values calculated after dosing with DOTTI ranged from 5.9 to 7.7 hours. After removal of the transdermal systems, serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone returned to baseline levels within 24 hours.\n - Adhesion\n - Based on combined data from 3 short-term clinical trials consisting of 471 observations, 85% of DOTTI adhered completely to the skin over the 3.5-day wear period. Three percent (3%) of the systems detached and were reapplied or replaced during the 3.5-day wear period. Approximately 80% of the transdermal systems evaluated in these studies were DOTTI 0.05 mg per day.\n\n12.1 Mechanism of Action:\n - Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.\n - The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.\n - Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, 2 estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.\n - Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.\n\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics:\n - Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman\u2019s therapeutic response to DOTTI nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 69613, "end_char_idx": 73699, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b89c2bdc-6831-4b14-8801-17afbe8496ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "b89c2bdc-6831-4b14-8801-17afbe8496ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a24f2e2-d005-48cc-9e0b-3d23a0a072d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "680558fbaeec4e5665386ccd7fd01351be1c26c7954e14604465d0754aae91c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "48b63c32-89e8-4fd1-8400-51aa1874e3e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "871067ea3587a36dcab99acece6e66e6d3f81919c7c2a882fc13da1c1a63de2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.\n - Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues.

Systems that deliver nominal estradiol doses of approximately 0.0375 mg per day and 0.1 mg per day were applied to abdominal application sites while the 0.1 mg per day doses were also applied to sites on the buttocks. These systems increased estradiol levels above baseline within 4 hours and maintained respective mean levels of 25 and 79 pg/mL above baseline following application to the abdomen; slightly higher mean levels of 88 pg/mL above baseline were observed following application to the buttocks. At the same time, increases in estrone plasma concentrations averaged about 12 and 50 pg/mL, respectively, following application to the abdomen and 61 pg/mL for the buttocks. While plasma concentrations of estradiol and estrone remained slightly above baseline at 12 hours following removal of the systems in this study, results from another study show these levels to return to baseline values within 24 hours following removal of the systems.\n - Figure 1 illustrates the mean plasma concentrations of estradiol at steady-state during application of these patches at 4 different dosages.\n - Figure 1.

In 2 controlled clinical trials with the original estradiol formulation, of 356 women, the 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at Week 4, and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment.

All doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.0375 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.075 mg, and 0.1 mg) are effective for the control of vasomotor symptoms.\n - Efficacy and safety of the original estradiol formulation in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied in a 2-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A total of 261 hysterectomized (161) and non-hysterectomized (100), surgically or naturally menopausal women (within 5 years of menopause), with no evidence of osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density within 2 standard deviations of average peak bone mass, i.e., at least 0.827 g/cm2) were enrolled in this study; 194 women were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.1, 0.05, 0.0375, or 0.025 mg/day) and 67 patients to placebo. Over 2 years, study systems were applied to the buttock or the abdomen twice a week. Non-hysterectomized women received oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/day) throughout the study.\n - The study population comprised naturally (82%) or surgically (18%) menopausal, hysterectomized (61%) or non-hysterectomized (39%) women with a mean age of 52 years (range 27 to 62 years); the mean duration of menopause was 31.7 months (range 2 to 72 months). Two hundred thirty-two (89%) of randomized women (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Women were given supplemental dietary calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium/day) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all the original estradiol formulation dose groups; in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients. All estradiol doses were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at all time points with the exception of estradiol 0.05 mg/day at 6 months. The highest dose of estradiol was superior to the 3 lower doses. There were no statistically significant differences in pairwise comparisons among the 3 lower doses (See Figure 3).\n - Figure 3.

The highest estradiol dose was superior to placebo at all time points. A mixture of significant and nonsignificant results were obtained for the lower dose groups at earlier time points.

According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d. The absolute excess risk of events included in the \u201cglobal index\u201d was 19 per 10,000 women-years.\n - For those outcomes included in the WHI \u201cglobal index\u201d that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.\n - Results of the CE plus MPA substudy, which included 16,608 women (average 63 years of age, range 50 to 79, 83.9% White, 6.8% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 3.9% Other) are presented in Table 4.

In 2 controlled clinical trials with the original estradiol formulation, of 356 women, the 0.075 and 0.1 mg doses were superior to placebo in relieving vasomotor symptoms at Week 4, and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. In this original study, the 0.0375 and 0.05 mg doses, however, did not differ from placebo until approximately Week 6, therefore, an additional 12-week, placebo-controlled study in 255 women was performed with the original estradiol formulation to establish the efficacy of the lowest dose of 0.0375 mg. The baseline mean daily number of hot flushes in these 255 women was 11.5. Results at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 of treatment are shown in Figure 2.\n - Figure 2. Mean (SD) Change from Baseline in Mean Daily Number of Flushes for Estradiol 0.0375 mg Versus Placebo in a 12-week Trial\n - The 0.0375 mg dose was superior to placebo in reducing both the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms at Week 4 and maintained efficacy through Weeks 8 and 12 of treatment. All doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.0375 mg, 0.05 mg, 0.075 mg, and 0.1 mg) are effective for the control of vasomotor symptoms.\n\n14.2 Effects on Bone Mineral Density\u00a0in Postmenopausal Women:\n - Efficacy and safety of the original estradiol formulation in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied in a 2-year, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 91343, "end_char_idx": 95127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d43170c2-eab1-44cd-9d4d-378fbdb60c0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d43170c2-eab1-44cd-9d4d-378fbdb60c0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "0e5aef5888f9f5074e224c03810ac8fb70b42bf8524440ca83a13d88e3181211", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc4ac23c-b0c1-4385-b4fd-915879026f83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/tmp/tmpvftyk64_/common/prescription/20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_name": "20240731_779751dc-243a-4dc2-ae67-3669f196b205.zip", "file_type": "application/zip", "file_size": 4680490, "creation_date": "2024-08-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-21"}, "hash": "dfad758fe2167eefca188591f16771cc7dbdd32556b47c0da12823dd5bbea1c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec898f3c-260b-4d1b-99fc-004b80154ff7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a09ce3364db4e640470b9d444711390ebfb49cc0013dc6741efd6573f364e9d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "- Figure 2.

A total of 261 hysterectomized (161) and non-hysterectomized (100), surgically or naturally menopausal women (within 5 years of menopause), with no evidence of osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral density within 2 standard deviations of average peak bone mass, i.e., at least 0.827 g/cm2) were enrolled in this study; 194 women were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses of the original estradiol formulation (0.1, 0.05, 0.0375, or 0.025 mg/day) and 67 patients to placebo. Over 2 years, study systems were applied to the buttock or the abdomen twice a week. Non-hysterectomized women received oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/day) throughout the study.\n - The study population comprised naturally (82%) or surgically (18%) menopausal, hysterectomized (61%) or non-hysterectomized (39%) women with a mean age of 52 years (range 27 to 62 years); the mean duration of menopause was 31.7 months (range 2 to 72 months). Two hundred thirty-two (89%) of randomized women (173 on active drug, 59 on placebo) contributed data to the analysis of percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) of the AP lumbar spine, the primary efficacy variable. Women were given supplemental dietary calcium (1000 mg elemental calcium/day) but no supplemental vitamin D. There was an increase in BMD of the AP lumbar spine in all the original estradiol formulation dose groups; in contrast to this, a decrease in AP lumbar spine BMD was observed in placebo patients. All estradiol doses were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at all time points with the exception of estradiol 0.05 mg/day at 6 months. The highest dose of estradiol was superior to the 3 lower doses. There were no statistically significant differences in pairwise comparisons among the 3 lower doses (See Figure 3).\n - Figure 3. Bone Mineral Density-AP Lumbar Spine Least Squares Means of Percentage Change from Baseline All Randomized Patients with at Least One Post-baseline Assessment Available with Last Post-baseline Observation Carried Forward\n - Analysis of percent change from baseline in femoral neck BMD, a secondary efficacy outcome variable, showed qualitatively similar results; all doses of the original estradiol formulation were significantly superior to placebo (p<0.05) at 24 months. The highest estradiol dose was superior to placebo at all time points. A mixture of significant and nonsignificant results were obtained for the lower dose groups at earlier time points.

The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A \u201cglobal index\u201d included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes.

The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the \u201cchange of life\u201d or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes \u201csurgical menopause.\u201d\n - When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating (\u201chot flashes\u201d or \u201chot flushes\u201d). In some women the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.\n - You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with DOTTI to control these problems. If you use DOTTI only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.\n - Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use DOTTI to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you.You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you should continue treatment with DOTTI.\n - Who should not useDOTTI? Do not start usingDOTTI if you:\n - Vaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus (womb). Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause.\n - Estrogens may increase the chances of getting certain types of cancers, including cancer of the breast or uterus (womb). If you have or have had cancer, talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should use DOTTI.\n - See the list of ingredients in DOTTI at the end of this leaflet.\n - Before you useDOTTI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\n - Your healthcare provider may need to check you more carefully if you have certain conditions such as asthma (wheezing), epilepsy (seizures), diabetes, migraine, endometriosis, lupus, angioedema (swelling of face and tongue); problems with your heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys, or have high calcium levels in your blood.\n - Your healthcare provider will let you know if you need to stop using DOTTI.\n - DOTTI is not for pregnant women.\n - The hormone in DOTTI can pass into your breast milk.\n - Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may affect how DOTTI works. DOTTI may also affect how your other medicines work.
